# E04d-Save-and-Load    

This is an opportunity for you to practice the simplest form of saving state in Godot, saving to a config file.

Fork this repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-04d-Save-and-Load. Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-F20 with your full name. Commit your changes.

Clone the repository to a Local Path on your computer.

Open Godot. Import the project.godot file and open the "Save and Load" project.

This exercise is taken from the [Basic Saving In Godot With Config Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygGaN1EOQEA) by Eric Davidson. His video will guide you through the steps required to save a value (in this case, the DisplayValue) to a config file and retrieve it when the player pushes the Save and Load buttons.

His tutorial was developed using Godot 3.1. Everything you see should be compatible with Godot 3.2, although some of the syntax highlighting might look slightly different.

After you have completed the exercise, run the program. Save a value of -3 to the config file.

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, add a summary message, commit your changes and push them back to GitHub. If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-04d-Save-and-Load) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing the "Created by" information with your name):
